# Link the Masses

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.3.

## Environment installation

Install NodeJS on your system. Make sure your system PATH variables are properly set up if on Windows OS. Open a terminal within the project directory with administrator priviledges. Run `npm install`, `cd server` and `npm install` waiting for completion at each command. 

## Development server

Open a terminal within the project directory and run `npm start` serve your frontend dev server. Open a separate terminal in the server folder found in the project directory and run `npm start`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Troubleshooting

We recommend running `npm install` both in the main folder and the server folder after pulling a branch. This will deal with any additions that may have been made to the package.json file.

If you continue to encounter installation problems after running `npm install`, it may be a good idea to delete the node_modules folder (which is generated when you run `npm install`), as the command sometimes fails to remove old dependencies correctly.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
